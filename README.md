IPython notebook with numerical calculations of GHG radiative forcing and atmospheric mass

Published in the SI of *Identifying/Quantifying Environmental Trade-offs Inherent in GHG Reduction Strategies for Coal-Fired Power*

Note: Some bugs have been discovered in the code, which change the magnitude of forcing. 
These have been corrected to some degree in the *Temperature.py* file. Using time steps 
other than 0.01 years may lead to incorrect absolute results. Relative results should
still be accurate.
